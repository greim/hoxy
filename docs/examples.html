<h1 id="examples" data-tldr="Snippets of example code.">Incantations</h1>

<p>
  Hoxy is not Magic Cargo From The Sky Gods&trade;.
  It has a fairly simple core architecture, and works in a predictable way.
  In order to assist the training of acolytes, however, the Magic Sky Gods have inspired the prophets to write down these incantations in The Book Of Spells.
</p>

<h3 id="unicorns">Unicorns!</h3>

<p>
  This incantation makes all titles say "Unicorns!" by manipulating the response as DOM.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept({
    phase: 'response',
    mimeType: 'text/html',
    as: '$'
  }, function(req, resp) {
    resp.$('title').text('Unicorns!');
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="slow-connection">Slow Connection</h3>

<p>
  This spell simulates a slow connection.
  This is done at the proxy level since two simultaneous requests would share the same connection.
  Thus for example a limit of 100000 bps for two requests would result in a speed of 50000 bps for each.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  hoxy.createServer({
    slow: { rate: 100000 }
  }).listen(8080);
</pre>

<h3 id="slow-website">Slow Website</h3>

<p>
  This spell simulates a slow website.
  It's as if just one website were slow, even if the rest of them run at normal speed.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept({
    phase: 'response',
    hostname: 'www.google.com'
  }, function(req, resp) {
    resp.slow({ rate: 10000 });
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="generator-intercept">Generator Interceptors</h3>

<p>
  One can invoke the deep magic of generator functions.
  Which are actually just functions that can pause while they're running.
  This is useful because async stuff can happen while things are paused.
  But you need to yield promises, which means using an adapter to turn callbacks into promises.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  var adapt = require('ugly-adapter');
  var fs = require('fs');
  proxy.intercept('request', function*(req, resp) {
    resp.buffer = yield adapt(fs.readFile, 'path/to/unicorns.gif');
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="async-intercept">Async Interceptors</h3>

<p>
  One can invoke the even deeper magic of async functions.
  Which work a lot like generators behind the scenes.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  var adapt = require('ugly-adapter');
  var fs = require('fs');
  proxy.intercept('request', async function(req, resp) {
    resp.buffer = await adapt(fs.readFile, 'path/to/unicorns.gif');
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="intercept-https">Intercept HTTPS</h3>

<p>
  There's an incantation for intercepting HTTPS traffic, too.
  But you have to burn some extra incense.
  First, create your very own self-signed Certificate Authority.
  (You should only ever need to do this once.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
  # Create the key
  openssl genrsa -out ~/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.key.pem 2048
  # Create the cert
  openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ~/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.key.pem -days 1024 -out ~/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.crt.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Utah/L=Provo/O=ACME Signing Authority Inc/CN=example.com"
</pre>

<p>
  Next, add the above root cert to your list of trusted cert authorities.
  How to do this varies from client to client and platform to platform.
  Firefox maintains its own trusted list.
  Chrome on OS X uses the ones stored in OS X's keychain.
  Describing them all is beyond the scope of these docs, suffice to say:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  ...make it trust the stuff...
</pre>

<p>
  Next, launch Hoxy, passing in that key and cert as a certificate authority.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  hoxy.createServer({
    certAuthority: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('/Users/you/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('/Users/you/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.crt.pem')
    }
  }).listen(8080);
</pre>

<p>
  Finally, configure your client to proxy both HTTP and HTTPS through <code>localhost:8080</code>.
  Hoxy will use the fake cert authority to spoof certificates from any HTTPS sites, decrypting and intercepting them as cleartext using the existing intercept API.
</p>

<h3 id="http-reverse">Create a reverse proxy</h3>

<p>
  Suppose you want to intercept your own web traffic to reddit.com.
  One option is to create a proxy, configure your client to use it, then visit reddit.com.
  If client configuration isn't feasible, another option is to use a reverse proxy.
  In this case you'd visit a url like <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> which would basically mirror the content of reddit.com.
  This is fairly easy to set up:
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  hoxy.createServer({
    reverse: 'http://www.reddit.com'
  }).listen(8080);
</pre>

<p>
  Now you can visit <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> and reddit will be there.
  Strictly speaking, by visiting the proxy directly in your browser rather than configuring it as a proxy, you're depriving the proxy of the scheme ("http:") and host ("www.reddit.com") information in the URL.
  The <code>reverse</code> option provides those missing pieces of information, allowing you to visit the proxy directly.
</p>

<h3 id="https-reverse">Create an HTTPS reverse proxy</h3>

<p>
  Suppose you wanted to reverse proxy to an HTTPS site.
  In that case you'll likely want the URL in your browser to be HTTPS as well.
  For that, just provide a key and cert that your client trusts.
  The instructions above already show how to create your own self-signed root CA.
  Do that, then use it to create your server's key and cert:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  # Create the key
  openssl genrsa -out ./my-server.key.pem 2048
  # Create the certificate signing request
  openssl req -new -key ./my-server.key.pem -out ./my-server.csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Utah/L=Provo/O=ACME Tech Inc/CN=local.ldsconnect.org"
  # Create the cert
  openssl x509 -req -in ./my-server.csr.pem -CA ~/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.crt.pem -CAkey ~/.ssh/my-private-root-ca.key.pem -CAcreateserial -out ./my-server.crt.pem -days 500
</pre>

<p>
  Then, launch your server with a <code>tls</code> option, like so:
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  hoxy.createServer({
    reverse: 'https://www.google.com',
    tls: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/my-server.key.pem),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/my-server.crt.pem')
    }
  }).listen(8080);
</pre>

<p>
  The <code>tls</code> option is passed to the underlying Node HTTPS server.
